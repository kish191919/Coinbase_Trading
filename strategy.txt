all right no stupid intro today I just want to get right into the meat of this thing I'm going to show you a trading strategy on the 1 hour time frame for Bitcoin and it is ridiculously effective as you can see we have btcusd up on the chart and I'm going to start showing you examples from Wednesday November 1st 20023 this right here is the previous High Point meaning that this was the previous higher high the move that broke the structure was this if you watch my previous video on PD arrays you know what this is it's just a gan box that shows you red on top and green on bottom PD Ray stands for premium and discount when markets are bullish you want to get in on discounted prices when markets are bearish you want to get in on premium prices so this is the move that broke structure as it got up here price was down here and moved up to a premium price a higher price than it was before price needs to pull back into a discounted area in order for you to go in a long position now this indicator that I'm going to show you here is extremely complex and can be used so many different ways it genuin L could fill up a 4-Hour video I have broken this down into the simplest most understandable way so that you can get a general idea of how powerful it is the indicator is called Outback and prints these little kangaroo symbols as your buy and sell positions usually what I do with PD arrays is only look for buy positions in these lower halves I completely disregard any sell positions but if you are an advanced Trader and you would like to scalp the move down before taking your longer position up you can do that with this indicator which I haven't seen anything that gives me reliable signals yet besides this one so if you are in an area of Premium you can take a short position into the area of discount very very short term before looking for your longer position on the bottom half of the premium discount array we did not get a signal down here but let's continue on with these examples this is the next move that broke the previous structure previous structure is denoted here by the top of the PD array first scalp back down into the range hit stop loss second scal scalp down into the range hit take profit we're doing 1 to 1.5 risk to reward ratios here once we got into the lower half of the PD array we take our long position depending on your skill level and if you want to do trailing stop losses this can be extremely powerful in a bull market in a minute I will extend these long positions out to show you the potential this is the next move that broke previous structure again denoted by the high of the PD aray taking a short position into the Zone this one got you a 1 to 2.5 taking two long positions from the bottom of the PD array both getting you your 1 to five this is the next move that broke the previous structure it's a doozy taking a short position down to that 50% level got you a 1 to 3.37 this is the next move that broke previous structure candle closure above the previous high points not just the Wicks taking another short down to the 50% level 1 to two extending the PD array out getting your long position here getting you your 1 to 1.5 after price has gotten into the lower half of this PD you are no longer taking short positions until you get above the previous structure next move that broke previous structure from here to here taking your short position here 1 to 1.5 didn't get any long positions on this PD array next move that broke previous structure didn't get a short position and we didn't get a long position next move that broke previous structure we got a short position that stop loss is ridiculous because there was a lot of volatility when you have big pushes like that you can move a couple of ticks above the previous candle getting you your 1 to 1.5 lower half of the PD aray taking a long position and you got stopped out once you get stopped out on a trade you should reverse your bias from long to short so we continue looking for sell positions on top and long positions on bottom this is the move that broke the previous structure that hit your stop loss taking a long position stopped out again this is the move that broke the previous structure again our bias is now bearish but we're still scalping to the other half of the PDD array taking a long position getting your 1 to 1.5 takeprofit hit now the PD array structure has been broken so now our bias is switched to long this is the move that broke the structure this candle closure was at the 50% level not good to take a scalp down this is the move that broke previous structure again previous structure denoted by the top of the PD Ray Short position looking for a 1 to 1.5 back into the lower half of this PD array then we got a long position from the bottom of the PD array right here looking for that 1: one .5 got it right there this is the move that broke the previous structure short position here did not have a deeper pull back into the lower half of the PDR that's okay you're going to have losing trades period this is the next move that broke previous structure both of these candle closures are too close to the 50% range so we don't take that tapped into the lower half of the PD aray take a long position another short position into the lower half of the PD aray this move did not break structure because it's a wick this is the next move a monstrous move that broke previous structure price pulled back into the lower half of the PD Ray and is now currently continuing up every single trade setup on a higher time frame since the beginning of November 2023 now let me show you these long positions so of our bullish movement this was the last higher low of all of the PD arrays so putting a horizontal line right there and I'm going to explain this right now every single one of these trades once it created a new PD array this lower half is now your new moving and floating stop loss so this trade you enter here and you move your stoploss essentially a trailing stoploss for all of these trades to hold them longer and you keep doing that taking advantage of the bullish momentum once price comes back and breaks the lower half of this PD array all of your long positions get closed so let's add it up this one right here minus 1% winning trade plus 1 and A2 this one right here + 7.4 + 1.5 + 14.4 + 13.3 + 3.3 + 1.9 + 1.9 + 1.5 + 1.5 minus1 minus one now again we're going long so our current stop losses are on these lows which as you can see has not been hit yet so you still in two open positions plus 20 5 that's ridiculous + 1.5 + 26 -1 + 1.5 and this last one right here would have been a loss also not worth taking because the risk to reward totaled all up up 97.7% since November this indicator is the new crypto King the indicator that I'm using is called Outback by ttf you can get access to it by the link in the description the settings that I'm using is is to make it clean and
